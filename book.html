        Friendship is a special bond that I have valued the most in my life.
I dont do this much and maybe will never do this kind of things for anyone else.
so lets start
Lets start from the beginning, March 2023 the year which started all.
As far as i remember you had posted a story regarding aot and as a
beginner anime fan was shocked there is a perosn despite 3 other I know
in my following who watches anime and it was you. I replied your story
regarding it we exchanged some tea. Each passing day reveals a new and better side of you. This went till june
I guess your college was started so we stopped talking. There was no
connection between us because few reels i sent and you used to ignore it
I dont mind that because it was all normal. Then after sooo much time around a year passed and comes the great and best
March 2024, From my goldfish memory it was random 2am at night and you posted
story again and i replied . It was you exam of english and you cant find the
problem statement for a specific topic. I helped you and just ends. But none
of us would have imagned what was gonna happen in few months. We Started chatting daily but mostly i used to spill and you replied.We had
normal talks how day went blah blah and I laugh now that i used to wish all
the best every morning before you exam and how it went every afternoon.Isnt
it cringe must be difficult to endure me. BY this MARCH ended. April started and you suddenly started watching last reels which i sent.April
went by nothing great between both of us. Then the month which is special May,
the most depressing month and most hated time of the year for me as usual I
used to send you reels and I havent send a single reel throughout the day and
you were the first person throughout my life who asked "Kha hai subah se
kidhar gayab hai" i couldnt expect throughout my life someone specially a girl
would ask me this and that almost made me cry and emotional. I was scared to share and open up because whenever i open up everyone laughed
and i was uncomfortable to share to a girl also . I tried to be strong willed
and spoke something rubbish and you immediately pointed out and said "bta" I
was so shocked that someone whom i havent met throughout my life could
understand me so much better than my nearby fellows. I opened up and you helped
me in overcoming in one of my biggest trauma in my life. That day i understood that this girl is very special and can do anything just
for her.You started watching more reels casual talks increase and everthing was
so touchy to heart that every convo was magical just like everyday. Everything is
beautiful and lovely.June came and I bought gift for you and you dont accept it i
was hurt for few days but it was gonna worse you disable your account and i cant
talk to you 'great thanks to everything i had done i made you angry.'And we couldnt talk to sept as i remember that you use snap as it got recommeded I
sent friend request.Normal talk happened but sure you werent happy. you dont sent the
snaps and doesnt opened which i had sent so i was frustated and delete the snapchat.
After some days you came back my finals got over and tbh last sem in which we started
talking my academics improved but got lot worse.Now october came you busy as usual and
me trying to figure out whats going on with my mind since you came. We talked normally
and then Nov came my birth month i expected no one to celebrate or enjoy my birthday as
it was most depressed month every year but first time in my life i expected atleast you
would remember becausewe had exactly 3 months gap no day before or after.And you forget
as usual and wished after seeing the story in evening that hurted me a lot that it took
whole december to figure out and then i understood that i am addicted to you. "The only thing i was addicted to was coffee or chai but they are
not addiction you are my biggest addiction till date."I told 2 days before i will be
going to disable my account and whole month passed and came new year.We wished each
other but nothing good. Then i came back and normal things happen.we had our fight
and hurted each other then solved after two weeks but still in that fight all day
my thought was your birthday and preparing the website.Your birthday came and thanks
for making me feel like i was something that matters in your life. I respected that
and felt like i was close to you. March 2025 the month 2 year knowing for me and 1 year for you . i was overwhelmed
by happiness whe you created a private account and doing things which i used to say
you should do and invinting me to be your presonal account member . We celebrated
but soon i began to feel that being you my friend is always pushing you down so i
started making distance so that you would remove me and start hating but you wont.
April came and we havent talked for whole month but its ok bith were high on egos.
MAy is going so nothing regarding that but "MAY WE BOTH NEVER BECOME STRANGERS"SO FOR ALL THIS RUBBISH MEANS TO REMEMBER SOME OF MEMORIES WHICH I HAD OF YOU
MY FRIEND
I just wanna say i am literally blessed by you and i cant undo the favour . I dont
think i deserve to be your friend i am too addicted to you and i got sad and angry over
little things which is not possible for you to fulfill so even if we dont talk daily
just wanna say never consider me a stranger. You are destined to be greatness you are so
positive that whenever i talk to you nithing bad happens but as soon as it stops
my world starts disrupting. You are My Everything Bro ðŸ’–.
i dont know about soulmates or bestfriends but you are someone who touched my soul and
i can do anything till here i am just dont loose that cute laugh and smile you have
with sparkle in your eyes.If i had solipsism then you are all the beauty and art my
mind created that it turned to be so beautiful,gorgeous,mesmerizing,cute,pretty and
pure hearted person. IF i say you are my home and comfort person it wouldnt be wrong
as you are the one the special of all to me.I know i am very insecure possesive and
toxic but still you talk daily if more than enough for a loser like me. I just want
to listen about your day and seeing you talk rather than reply.
